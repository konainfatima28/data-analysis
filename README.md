# Data Exploration and Prediction
A hands-on project focused on analyzing datasets through exploratory data analysis (EDA), cleaning, and visualization, followed by building predictive models to derive meaningful insights.

## Project Objectives
- Perform structured data exploration
- Identify key trends, patterns, and outliers
- Clean and preprocess raw data for model readiness
- Apply statistical techniques and machine learning algorithms for prediction
- Visualize data and model outcomes to support interpretability

## Technologies & Tools
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Machine Learning Algorithms (Linear Regression, Decision Trees, etc.)

## Whatâ€™s Included
- Exploratory Data Analysis notebooks
- Data cleaning and preprocessing scripts
- Model building and evaluation
- Visualizations and insights
- Performance metrics for predictions
